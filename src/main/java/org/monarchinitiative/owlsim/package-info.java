/**
 * Compute engines for matching query profiles (for example, a list of phenotypes) to
 * entities (for example, diseases) making use of a knowledge base (i.e. an ontoligy of
 * phenotypes and disease-phenotype associations).
 * 
 * This package is broken into the following layers:
 * <ul>
 *  <li> kb - representation of background knowledge
 *  <li> compute - engines for performing computations
 *  <li> io - input/output
 *  <li> model - data access objects
 * </ul>
