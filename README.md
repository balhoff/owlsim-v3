# owlsim-v3

Ontology Based Profile Matching

This will eventually replace sim2 currently distributed as part of owltools

## Documentation

For now you must do this:

    mvn javadoc:javadoc

And then open target/site/apidocs/index.html in a browser

## Running it

Currently there is no command line app, and no service layer.

For now, run junit tests in eclipse.

Also try the performance/integration tests in owlsim.compute.perf - these will need extra files downloaded
see the Makefile for details.
